# Task: Commit all changes and deploy to production

All code changes are complete and the build passes (113 modules, 0 errors). Your job is to commit everything, push to origin/master, and confirm Vercel deploys successfully.

## Step 1: Verify the build

Run `npm run build` and confirm 0 errors before doing anything else. If the build fails, stop and report the errors — do NOT commit broken code.

## Step 2: Stage all changes

Stage everything EXCEPT `.claude/settings.local.json` (that's local IDE config, not project code).

```bash
git add -A
git reset HEAD .claude/settings.local.json
```

## Step 3: Commit

Create a single commit with this message:

```
Tracking verification, clickable signal charts, cloud sync, and review fixes

- Signal verification drawer: click any signal card to see its rolling
  history chart with data provenance (z-score, Hurst, ATR, funding,
  distance-from-mean, stretch-Z)
- Setup tracking fixes: multi-window stats toggle (4h/24h/72h),
  both-hit resolution heuristic, extended candle backfill for stale
  pending setups, useSuggestedSetup stability, CSV export,
  unresolvable outcome marking
- Cloud sync: Supabase-backed state sync with shared passphrase,
  merge logic for setups/signals/outcomes, TrustPanel UI
- Signal logic fixes: Hurst ACF denominator, funding min samples,
  crypto volatility thresholds, entry geometry classification,
  decision engine neutral-composite guard
- Data flow fixes: duplicate WS handler removed, candle staleness
  check, tracker outcome resolution tightened
- UX: RiskResults key metrics at top, MethodologyBanner refactored,
  workflow guidance utilities extracted
- Review fixes: encoding-safe unicode escapes, focus trap TS guard,
  candleCountUsed double-count fix, sync timestamp tie consistency
```

## Step 4: Push

```bash
git push origin master
```

## Step 5: Verify deployment

Wait ~60 seconds, then check the Vercel deployment:

```bash
npx vercel ls --limit 1
```

Or check `https://levtrade.vercel.app` is live and responding.

## Step 6: Update COLLAB_LOG.md

Append a short entry to COLLAB_LOG.md documenting the commit and deployment. Include the commit hash and Vercel deployment URL. Then amend the commit to include the updated log:

```bash
git add COLLAB_LOG.md
git commit --amend --no-edit
git push --force-with-lease origin master
```

## IMPORTANT
- Do NOT modify any source code. Everything is already fixed and building.
- Do NOT run `npm install` or change dependencies.
- If the build fails, STOP and report — do not try to fix code.
