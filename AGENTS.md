# Agent Coordination

Before making edits in this repo:

1. Read [COLLAB_LOG.md](./COLLAB_LOG.md).
2. Check whether another agent already claimed the same area.
3. Avoid editing on top of unresolved work without updating the log first.

After making edits:

1. Append a new entry to `COLLAB_LOG.md`.
2. List the date, agent, goal, files changed, and any follow-up risks or next steps.
3. If you intentionally leave work incomplete, say exactly what remains.
